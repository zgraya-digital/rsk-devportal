"Nifty Wallet is discontinued. As a result of changing crypto market conditions and to continually improve support for our growing family of Gnosis Chain products, certain existing products will be retired in 2022. This list includes the Nifty Wallet browser wallet. Nifty Wallet extension will be delisted from Google Chrome web store in the near future. ([source](https://www.poa.network/v/master-1/for-users/nifty-wallet))" - Nifty Wallet Developers.

See [guide](https://www.poa.network/v/master-1/for-users/nifty-wallet) on how to move or export your RBTC.

## Disclaimer

- Currency may be mistakenly displayed as `ETH` within some screens of MetaMask.
  The RSK network uses `RBTC` as its cryptocurrency.
- This tutorial uses [RSK public nodes](/rsk/public-nodes).
  You can connect to another node by changing the RPC URL.
- The node must enable CORS for browser-based DApps to work.
  - Please review the [configuration file reference](/rsk/node/configure) for CORS settings.
